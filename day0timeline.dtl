playercharacter: Welcome! You are at your high school reunion. It’s already been 15 years since you’ve graduated! You and your old best friend, William, go around reconnecting with old friends, teachers, and classmates.
playercharacter: Success! Everyone looks the same as they were younger and seem to all have turned successful. You and William are having fun, drinking, joking, and laughing.  
playercharacter: You and William have a lot to drink and reminisce about old times. You guys talk about your old friend Sam who died in an incident 1 year ago and how it’s unfortunate that you guys can’t drink together like you guys use to back in the old days. William seems a little nervous when you mention Sam but you quickly have another shot and forget about it.
playercharacter: At midnight you and William go back to your hotel separately, William said he had to meet someone to apologize before going back.
playercharacter: You go back to your hotel and sleep but the next day you find out William fell off the roof and died. They found something untraceable in William’s system but ruled it as an accident due to alcohol. 
There is no way this was an accident! First Sam died and now William is dead, this must be murder. You narrow it down to three students that you, Sam, and William used to bully in high school - Peter, Vincent, and Alex.
If you cannot correctly solve the murder in three days, you’ll be next, so you must act fast. Every day, you’ll have the opportunity to meet and chat with one of the three suspects to gather clues. Good luck…
